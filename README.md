The project runs in Thread.cpp. I use Ubuntu on Windows to run this code. If you have Ubuntu, run this code using Ubuntu and open the Terminal. Type "g++ Thread.cpp" to compile the code, and then type "./a.out" to run the code.
This files includes some TESTINGs files that can be used to see the compression and decompression.
My Thread.cpp works efficiency on very large text files, but not small text files.
